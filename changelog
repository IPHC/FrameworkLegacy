# =================================================== #
#  Changes from SkyFall to RiverSong-v1 - 25/01/2013  #
# =================================================== #

* Leptons

  * Removed all isolation variables for Electrons and Muons ;
  * Added an "isolation" KeyedCollection in NTLepton meant to store all
  isolation-related infos ;
  * Moved a few variables from MTElectron to NTElectron ;
  * Moved dxy_vertex and dz_vertex from NTElectron and NTMuon to NTLepton ;

* Jets

  * Removed unused NTJetMet class ;
  * Added NTSubJet class ;
  * Added a vector of NTSubJet in NTJet ;
  * Added a vector of TLorentzVector in MTJet, called "constituents" ;
  * Added a "HeavyTag" KeyedCollection in NTJet, meant to be used for W/Top
  tagging ;
  * Added "jetCharge" variable to NTJet ;

* Monte-Carlo infos

  * Added a "decayMode" attribute to NTGenParticle, meant to encode the type
  of decay for taus and heavy quarks, in the same way of TMEME ;
  * Added a "xpdf" attribute to NTMonteCarlo, to store info related to pdf
  used by MC generator ;
  * Added "Tnpv" attribute to PileUp, corresponding to the true number of
  interactions, to be used instead of intime/before/after_npu ;
  * Added "mcMotherId" attribute to WDecaysMC and ZDecaysMC, corresponding
  to the pdgId of the mothers of the W/Z ;

* Other stuff

  * Added "others" KeyedCollection for PFCandidates ;
  * Updated MTTransient and NTTransient ;
  * Minor changes here and there

* MiniTree

  * Pile-up densities (rho and neutralRho) are now saved also for data ;
  * Final decays of taus and leptonic decays of heavy quarks filled in the
  NTGenParticle vector (depending on cfg.py) ;
  * Added filling of the new isolation KeyedCollection for Electrons and Muons ;

* cfg.py

  * Merged the boolean/inputTag related to saving information of matching
  between two different Electron or Muon collection ;
  * Added a vector of string named "Isolist", meant to list the tags of
  isolation info that user want to save ;
  * Added a vector of string for electron config, to choose which
  rho-correction to save ;
  * Added booleans to enable/disable the filling of SubJets and constituents for
  jets ;
  * Added three-state switch to config which info to save about taus and heavy
  quarks decay.
